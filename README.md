"Computer science is the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solutions that come out of the problem-solving process. Given a problem, a computer scientist’s goal is to develop an algorithm, a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise. Algorithms are finite processes that if followed will solve the problem. Algorithms are solutions." http://buff.ly/1tz3gEe

_It took a long time for society to realize the benefits of teaching everyone to **read**; now the question before us is whether everyone should **learn** to program. What do you think?_
- Don Knuth: Programming, of course, is not just an ordinary subject. It is intrinsically empowering, and applicable to many different kinds of knowledge. And I also know that you've been having enormous successes, at Princeton and online, teaching advanced concepts of programming to students from every discipline. http://buff.ly/1zt4sI6 #4thR

If you're a scientist or engineer, programming can enable you to work 10 to 100 times faster and to come up with more creative solutions than your colleagues who don't know how to program.

### The Roadmap 
_The PC-1 content + a 1:1 Mentoring Ratio involving an Enthusiastic Faculty + a Motivated Student who is willing to struggle + 4 Doses will generate fundamental C Programming Skills. And that's a guarantee._

- **TEACH** - Time, Effort (hard work), ambition (urgent), confidence, heart (passion, interest, [fun][cff])
- The Progression
  - Problem sets
    - PC-1 (_needs refactoring_)
      - Dose-0, Dose-1, Dose-2, Dose-3 ([_SpacedRepetition_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition))
    - PC-2
    - Mentor guided sets (and many more, progressively challenging ones) 
  - Lab Reforms 
    - [Nifty][nifty] assignments (personal Facebook, most visited pages in a website, etc)
  - Projects 
    - Coding for [Fun][cff]

### Show and Tell
![Image](CoDE/docs/moveForward.png?raw=true)
- We shall use **[Blockly Maze][Maze]** to introduce Loops, Conditionals
  - approx. 60min - 90min
  - Alternative - [HourOfCode][Maze2]

### Problem Sets
_Pre-requisite: A familiarity with standard IO functions like **printf** and **scanf** is recommended, but not mandatory_

- A gentle, low-cognitive, domain-free (almost), progressively challenging coverage of
  the most important **programming constructs** in the C Programming language.
  - [Iteration 1](CoDE/pset1-local.md) (Click [here](CoDE/pset1.md) for external access)
    - [CC-Intro-Local](https://10.100.1.147/cloudcoder/#exercise?c=26,p=957) 
    - [CC-Intro-Ext](https://cloudcoder.kgisl.com/cloudcoder/#exercise?c=26,p=978) 
  - OOPs in C++ Sets
    - Problem sets are available [here](CoDE/oop-local.md) ([here](CoDE/oop.md) for external access)

### Problem Solving through Programming
- Listen to the lectures [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL94CA590D7781A9B9)
- Anton Spraul on Problem Solving on [YouTube](http://goo.gl/TrOv0F)

### Ultimately
- Reach out to a mentor and do as many challenging [problems][Mentor20] as possible
- Create a Sphero + Blockly + QuadCopter combination for solving a Maze Challenge

### Inspiration
- How to learn [Regex](http://regexone.com/lesson/0) in the most elegant manner?
  - what can we learn from this? 
  - How to emulate this?
