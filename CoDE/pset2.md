**Iteration 3**
 - Get a good mentor and ask him to coach you on more [challenges][Mentor20] 
   - Stroustrup: "A good mentor is the best help a student can have; 
                 maybe that's why they are not easy to find.” 
                 http://buff.ly/Z4kqLr #4thR
 - Get more challenging problems
 - Solve it along with him - watch him over his shoulder
